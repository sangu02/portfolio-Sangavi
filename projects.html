            <h3>2.ðŸš—Road Lane Line Detection for Autonomous Cars </h3>
                
            <p>The Road Lane Line Detection System is a computer vision-based solution that identifies lane markings on roads in real-time. This project is crucial for autonomous vehicles and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), ensuring vehicles stay in the correct lane while driving. Using OpenCV and Java, the system processes live camera feeds or recorded videos, applies edge detection techniques, and identifies lane markings. This project forms the foundation for self-driving cars, helping them understand and navigate the road.

                <p>Advantages of the System</p>
                   <li>âœ… Improves road safety by helping vehicles stay within lanes</li> 
                    <li>âœ… Reduces manual driving errors, making roads safer</li>
                    <li>âœ… Supports self-driving technology by identifying lanes for navigation</li>
                   <li> âœ… Can be integrated with LiDAR and GPS for better accuracy</p></li>
